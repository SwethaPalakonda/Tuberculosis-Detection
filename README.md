# Tuberculosis-Detection
Tuberculosis (TB) detection refers to the process of identifying the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the bacterium responsible for causing tuberculosis. TB primarily affects the lungs but can also spread to other parts of the body. Traditional methods of TB detection include clinical evaluations based on symptoms like persistent cough, fever, weight loss, and night sweats, as well as diagnostic tools such as chest X-rays, sputum smear microscopy, tuberculin skin tests, and molecular tests like the GeneXpert MTB/RIF. In recent years, advancements in artificial intelligence and deep learning have led to the development of automated TB detection systems using medical imaging. These systems use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to analyze chest X-ray images for signs of tuberculosis. For example, models like MobileNetV2 have been employed to build lightweight yet accurate classifiers capable of distinguishing between TB-infected and normal lung images. Such AI-based solutions offer faster, scalable, and more accessible screening, especially in resource-limited settings, aiding early detection and timely treatment.
